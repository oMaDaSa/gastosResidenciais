# Residential Expenses Manager

## About

This is a simple application for managing household expenses.  
It allows you to:

- Add and remove users.
- Add **income transactions** for users who are over 18.
- Add **expense transactions** for all users.
- View the **total income, total expenses, and net balance** on the main interface.

The main purpose of this project is to test the integration between a React-based frontend and a Spring Boot Java backend.

> ⚠️ The application uses an in-memory database, so **data will not persist** between restarts.
